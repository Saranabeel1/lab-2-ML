# Lab 2: Machine Learning Problem Definition

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** Iris Flower Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Problem Definition
- **Type of Problem:** Classification
- **Target Variable:** Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
- **Features:** Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

## Problem Statement
Using measurements of flower petals and sepals, I want to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower.

## Example Output
