# Lab 2: Iris Dataset - Machine Learning Problem

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** Iris Flower Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Problem Definition
- **Type of Problem:** Classification
- **Target Variable:** Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
- **Features:** Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

## Expected Output
A trained classification model that can:
- Achieve high accuracy in predicting iris species
- Identify which measurements are most important for classification
- Correctly distinguish between similar species

## Problem description
Using measurements of flower petals and sepals, I want to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower.
